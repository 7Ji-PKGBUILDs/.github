PKGBUILDs maintained / co-maintained by [7Ji](https://github.com/7Ji)

This is also where [7Ji's arch repo](https://github.com/7Ji/archrepo) updates the PKGBUILDs from. However, issues related to the packages downloaded from there should not be opened here.

Some of the Arch-independent packages are also available on AUR.

Others, mostly aarch64-specific ones, were previously or currently available on AUR, but will be purged soon and this will be the canon and only place to host them.
